Our project aims to build a dynamic and scalable e-commerce platform using Next.js, a popular framework for building server-side rendered React applications. By leveraging Next.js dynamic pages, we can create a fast and responsive user experience that is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

As already said in the beginning the key feature of this project is the use of dynamic pages to display product information. By using Next.js's dynamic pages, we can create unique pages for each product that are optimized for search engines and social sharing. These pages will include detailed product information, high-quality images, and user reviews to help shoppers make informed purchasing decisions.
